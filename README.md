This is an Arduino based fast charging hub that can charge up to three smartphones at the same time and you can view the voltage, watts and amperes going to all three smartphones on the LCD ST7789

When a smartphone is plugged into it for charging, it will automatically sense how many volts, watts and amperes it needs to charge and adjust itself to the smartphone's needs.
